# Womanium-Quantum-Drug-Discovery
The project outlines using Bioinformatics, AI and Quantum Machine Learning to find Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors as targets in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

Drug discovery is the process of identifying chemical entities that are good therapeutic
targets. My proposal outlines using Quantum Machine Learning to find
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors as targets in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Machine
Learning and AI help find the most feasible targets in the least amount of time, leading
to cost benefits for pharmaceuticals through the clinical trial phase.
AD is the most common form of dementia causing cognitive disabilities for millions of
people around the world. AChE inhibitors are a common treatment for AD, examples of
drugs include donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine. These drugs compensate for
the death of cholinergic neurons and offer symptomatic relief.
